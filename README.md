# Replicate MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/mcp-sdk/mcp) server implementation for Replicate. Run Replicate models through a simple tool-based interface.

## Quickstart

1. Install the server:

```bash
npm install -g mcp-replicate
```

2. Get your Replicate API token:
   - Go to [Replicate API tokens page](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens)
   - Create a new token if you don't have one
   - Copy the token for the next step

3. Configure Claude Desktop:
   - Open Claude Desktop Settings (<kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>,</kbd>)
   - Select the "Developer" section in the sidebar
   - Click "Edit Config" to open the configuration file
   - Add the following configuration, replacing `your_token_here` with your actual Replicate API token:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "replicate": {
      "command": "mcp-replicate",
      "env": {
        "REPLICATE_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Start Claude Desktop. You should see a 🔨 hammer icon in the bottom right corner of new chat windows, indicating the tools are available.

(You can also use any other MCP client, such as Cursor, Cline, or Continue.)

## Alternative Installation Methods

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepfates/mcp-replicate
cd mcp-replicate
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### Run with npx

```bash
npx mcp-replicate
```

## Features

### Models
- Search models using semantic search
- Browse models and collections
- Get detailed model information and versions

### Predictions
- Create predictions with text or structured input
- Track prediction status
- Cancel running predictions
- List your recent predictions

### Image Handling
- View generated images in your browser
- Manage image cache for better performance

## Configuration

The server needs a Replicate API token to work. You can get one at [Replicate](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens).

There are two ways to provide the token:

### 1. In Claude Desktop Config (Recommended)

Add it to your Claude Desktop configuration as shown in the Quickstart section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "replicate": {
      "command": "mcp-replicate",
      "env": {
        "REPLICATE_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. As Environment Variable

Alternatively, you can set it as an environment variable if you're using another MCP client:

```bash
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

## Available Tools

### Model Tools
- `search_models`: Find models using semantic search
- `list_models`: Browse available models
- `get_model`: Get details about a specific model
- `list_collections`: Browse model collections
- `get_collection`: Get details about a specific collection

### Prediction Tools  
- `create_prediction`: Run a model with your inputs
- `get_prediction`: Check a prediction's status
- `cancel_prediction`: Stop a running prediction
- `list_predictions`: See your recent predictions

### Image Tools
- `view_image`: Open an image in your browser
- `clear_image_cache`: Clean up cached images
- `get_image_cache_stats`: Check cache usage

## Troubleshooting

### Server is running but tools aren't showing up

1. Check that Claude Desktop is properly configured with the MCP server settings
2. Ensure your Replicate API token is set correctly
3. Try restarting both the server and Claude Desktop
4. Check the server logs for any error messages

### Tools are visible but not working

1. Verify your Replicate API token is valid
2. Check your internet connection
3. Look for any error messages in the server output

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server (with auto-reload):
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Check code style:
```bash
npm run lint
```

4. Format code:
```bash
npm run format
```

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- TypeScript >= 5.0.0
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) for using the tools
